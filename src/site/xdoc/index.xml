                <p><strong><a href="http://tiles.apache.org">Apache Tiles</a></strong>
                is a templating framework built to simplfy the development of web
                application user interfaces.</p>

                <p>Tiles allows authors to define page fragements which can be assembled
                into a complete page at runtime.  These fragments, or tiles, can be used 
                as simple includes in order to reduce the duplication of common page
                elements or embeded within other tiles to develop a series of reusable
                templates. These templates streamline the development of a consistent 
                look and feel across an entire application.</p>

                <p>Tiles grew in popularity as a component of the popular 
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org">Struts</a> framework.  It has since
                been extracted from Struts and is now integrated with various frameworks,
                such as <a href="http://struts.apache.org">Struts2</a>, 
                <a href="http://shale.apache.org">Shale</a>, and 
                <a href="http://velocity.apache.org">Velocity</a>.</p>

                <p>As new top level project, Tiles does not yet have any official
                releases.  However, snapshots are occasionally published to
                Apache's Maven 2 snapshot repository, which can be accessed with
                the following configuration:</p>

                <source><![CDATA[
                  <repository>
                      <id>apache.snapshots</id>
                      <name>Apache Maven Snapshot Repository</name>
                      <url>http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository</url>
                  </repository>
                ]]>
                </source>

                <p>After configuring the repository, declare a dependency on
                Tiles 2:</p>

                <source><![CDATA[
                  <dependency>
                      <groupId>org.apache.tiles</groupId>
                      <artifactId>tiles-core</artifactId>
                      <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                  </dependency>
                ]]>
                </source>

            <p>If you are not using Maven 2, you can find a recent development
            snapshot of tiles-core.jar <a
            href="http://people.apache.org/maven-snapshot-repository/org/apache/struts/tiles/tiles-core/">
            here</a>, or a nightly build, <a
            href="http://people.apache.org/builds/struts/nightlies/tiles/">here</a>.</p>

           <p>You can see Tiles 2 in action by downloading a snapshot of the 'tiles-test' webapp,
           <a href="http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/struts/tiles/tiles-test/2.0-SNAPSHOT/">
           here</a>.</p>
