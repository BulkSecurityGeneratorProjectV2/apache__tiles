                    Project committers are the core Apache Tiles community.
                </p>

                <p>When I graduated from school in 1999 I headed to Flower Mound,
                    Texas (a Dallas suberb) where my wife Teresa had grown up.
                    I was fortunate to find my first web development contract
                    and began my career on a portal development team providing
                    user interface implementation support.</p>

                <p>Since that first job, I have worked for a few small
                    consulting companies providing J2EE design and development
                    consulting to mid sized and Fortune 500 clients. Many of the
                    projects I've been involved in over the yeras have leveraged
                    struts and tiles. I also have used other web frameworks
                    such as JSF and Tapestry.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 2006 I left full time employment in order to
                    begin
                    <a href="http://www.threepillarsoftware.com">
                        Three Pillar Software, Inc
                    </a>
                    . This move was driven by my
                    desire to spend more time doing the things I love (developing
                    open source software, agile coaching, spending time with my
                    wife and kids, etc. . .) and less time in corporate meetings
                    and sales calls.</p>

                <p>I am also a committer for
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/"> Apache Struts </a>,
                    <a href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto"> Apache Pluto </a>,
                    a member of the JSR-286 Expert Group, an author of
                    various online articles and have been known to speak at conferences
                    such as ApacheCon US 2005, Agile2006, and SD Best Practices 2006.
                    In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife Teresa and
                    our 4 kids (under 6!), Sarah, Joseph, Rebekah, and Catherine. We
                    now live in Northern Virginia. </p>
